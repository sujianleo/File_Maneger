# Folder Flow Organizer

This desktop application, powered by `PyQt5`, lets you reorder folders with drag-and-drop, apply tidy numbering, and capture ideas alongside your workspace.

## How to run

1. Install Python 3 and the dependency:
   ```bash
   pip install pyqt5
   ```
2. From the project root, launch the app:
   ```bash
   python file_manager.py
   ```

Once it opens, drop a folder onto the window or paste a path into the address box to get started.

## Highlights

- **Dual workspace** – Manage inspiration and to-dos at the top while keeping your folder operations below.
- **Drag-and-drop sorting** – Reorder folders directly in the list. Resume sorting to apply fresh numeric prefixes automatically.
- **Contextual tools** – Right-click folders to create, rename, delete, reserve, or clear numbering with ease.
- **Double-click actions** – Open folders in your system file manager or mark notes as finished with a quick double-click.
- **Reserved folders** – Flag specific folders so they remain untouched by batch operations.
- **Smart persistence** – The latest path, reserved list, and your idea log are saved in `last_state.json` for next time.
- **Live refresh** – The list keeps an eye on directory changes and refreshes itself automatically.

## Build an executable

You can package the project with [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/) in two ways:

- **Single executable**
  ```bash
  pyinstaller file_manager.spec
  ```
  The bundled app is generated in the `dist/` directory.
- **Directory build (faster startup)**
  ```bash
  python build_dist.py
  ```
  This creates `dist/file_manager/`, avoiding the self-extraction delay of the one-file mode.
